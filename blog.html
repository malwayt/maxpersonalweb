                <b>Introduction:</b> <br> <br>
            
            Copa Airlines was founded in 1947 with the goal to bring aviation to domestic Panamanian customers. 70 years later, Copa is a thriving airline based in Panama City, Panama managing 355 daily flights to over 70 airports and 30 countries.  They aim to become the dominant airline in South/Central America by focusing on their strategic and convenient location at the intersection of South and Central America, giving the best customer service, keeping operating costs low and continuing to expand quickly with new partnerships, airplanes and flights. They currently fly 98 airplanes, and at the time of this report are trading at $134.88. Copa had their IPO in December 2005 and reported their most recent earnings as of this report (Q3) on November 9th, 2017.<br> <br>

            <b>Analysis:</b> <br> <br>
            
            2017 has been a rebound year for CPA. From their all-time high price of $160 in December 2013, Copa was on a fast fall until they hit $46.33 in June 2015, a fall of over 70%. Since the low in 2015, Copa has been on a steady rebound, and looks to continue this through 4Q2017 and 2018. To back up this rebound, we can delve into the financials. Copa revenue is on track to increase year-on-year for the first time since 2012-13, with 2016 revenues of $2.2B, Copa has already hit $1.9B in revenue through three quarters of 2017. <br> <br>
            
            Copa is hitting these high revenue numbers despite multiple hardships, for example in 3Q2017 they cited 1.5% of their total flights were canceled due to natural disasters and inclement weather, resulting in $12M in lost revenue. Copa also experienced tension from their employees in a brief pilot strike during the summer of 2017 which was not mentioned in the 2Q2017 earnings report. They have also made it a big point to continue saving money and cutting costs, working on their operating margin, one of their prized competitive advantages. On the 3Q2017 earnings call, CEO Pedro Helibron referenced $15M saved through small adjustments, and investments in their mobile app and new managing software that will save them more money in the future. Compared to annual data, operating expenses have decreased every year since 2014, and are still on track to in 2017. In 2017 CPA reported $1.5B in operating expenses through three quarters, on track to finish with around $1.9B in expenses, a projected 2% YoY decrease on a large budget, while continuing to expand their fleet and locations served. <br> <br>
                
            Delving deeper into the pitfalls of 2015 and 2016, factors include higher gas prices and failure to hit operational margins. One of Copa’s main advertised advantages is that they provide the best service, at the highest operational margins. In 2016 they saw their margins drop to 12.4%, a dismal number compared to their normal 17%-20%. In 2017 they reported their margins back up to 18%, and expect the same in 2018. Gas prices were also drastically different, while in 2015/2016 they were paying between $2.16 to $1.90 on average for a gallon, prices dripped down to $1.84/gallon in 2016. While this is harder to predict and less dependent on the company, gas prices are predicted to stay level for at least the next 4 quarters.  When examining the EBITDA, the net profit loss ($224M) CPA posted in 2015 doesn’t look entirely as bad. The EBITDA that year was only ($50M), and the 2016 EBITDA was at $556M, above the 2014 high year of $525M. While their financial and other fees are obviously high and seem to stay closely stagnant in their year to year deductions, the 2015 loss is not very bad in the long term of the company. Since then Copa has continued to cut operational costs, continued to expand to more markets with more planes, continued to hit more revenue, demonstrated their high margins stated in their thesis, and decreased company liabilities. <br> <br>
                
             <b>Institutional Holders:</b> <br> <br> 
                
            CPA is 93% held by institutions, mainly JP Morgan ($386M), Morgan Stanley ($148M) and Blackrock ($97M). Many large emerging market mutual funds also include CPA in their portfolios, including Fidelity, Baron and Vanguard. <br> <br>
                
            <b>Verdict:</b> <br> <br> 
                
            Copa’s stock price is up about 45% YTD (12/11/17) and is up 5.5% in the last month.  Copa Airlines beat their earnings in 2 out of 3 quarters this year, missing Q2 earnings by one cent. Copa has demonstrated a will to expand far beyond Latin America, and seems to be on the trajectory to do so. With their future of expansion, Copa cites orders of 82 various airplanes, and increase of around 84% to its fleet by 2024. Based on the above analysis, previous 2017 growth supplemented by the steady economy, I see CPA growing another 15-25% in the next 6-12 months easily. <br> <br>
