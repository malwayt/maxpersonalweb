            Wanted to learn more on how investors think, and how I could eventually enter investing. Great book, had a hard time putitng it down. Very straight forward steps on how to evaluate companies and how to get into the investing game. Loved it, and Jason replied to an email I sent him after! <br> <br>
            
            <b>- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a></b> by Ben Horowitz. Q1 2018 <br> 
            Another startup classic, amazing book. Ben goes into great detail on his life story, and many of the experiences he had during his time running his startup that turned into a $1.6B company. He lays out many frameworks for managing employees and building companies, questions to ask during interviews, and other great, in detail tips. Must read for managers and founders.  <br> <br>

            A famed startup classic, written in response to a class Thiel taught at Stanford. Amazing insights, extreamly accionable. Highly recommend if you are a founder. <br> <br>
        
            
            <b>- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0773543791/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0">Up and To the Right</a></b> by Craig Toomey. Q4 2017 <br> 
            Picked this up to learn some more trading tips and about John Dobson, an investor I had never heard of. I was intrigued  by his sucess and his influence in Canada, and especially his process of running his Formula Growth Fund. While a lagre amount of the book is about his life and his ideals, there are a few chapters that break down the investment dilligence process and their returns which I enjoyed the most.  <br> <br>
            
            <b>- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1511027948&sr=1-1&keywords=lean+startup">The Lean Startup</a></b> by Eric Weis. Q4 2017 <br>
            I finally bought this after being recomended it for more than 6 months, and it was completly worth it. Awesome book, containted so many great ideas and processes. Thought some of it was a little redundant, but enjoyed the included case studies. Read it on my phone, not as a hardcover, and that made it go a little slower + harder to take notes. <br> <br>

            I'm a huge fan of these two guys, and this of course did not disapoint. Same style as the first two books, and just as entertaining. Learn a lot about business and people, and it's a short + fast read, will def re-read it at some point. I'll buy whatever they write together. <br> <br>
            
            <b>- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Rob-Bank-Suggestions-Well-Intended/dp/0062385801/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1511038653&sr=1-1&keywords=when+to+rob+a+bank">When to Rob a Bank</a></b> by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. Q3 2017 <br>  
            A collection of blog posts from their Freakonomics blog, it is about 170 individual posts jammed into a book. Personally I did not enjoy this as much, as I loved the flow of the more traditional books they have written. Many of the posts in this book do not have research or studies accompanying them, and many end in questions. While this is fine, and they do not play it up and sell it like their other books, I did not enjoy this as much as their other masterpieces.  <br> <br>

            Very funny, cool and creative fiction novel. Great ending, great characters. I'll be reading more books by Moore when I look for an escape from non-fiction (he has a lot). <br> <br>
            
           <b>- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0451482212">Between the World and Me</a></b> by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Q3 2017 <br>  
            Amazing, capivating writting, describing the views of Coates and a personal story that angers him. He looks into the American system and it's flaws, in an angry, fed up approach. I enjoyed this short read, and thought the writting was provoking and powerful. <br> <br>

            Similar style to Levvit and Dubner, awesome look at behavioaral economics, one of my fav types of books. <br> <br>

            Cool book, gives a lot of specific examples and "how to's" which I enjoy and are helpful. Gives detail to the interesting concept of enchantment and how to bring it to your startup. I took pictures of a lot of pages to save as notes. <br> <br>

            Truly enjoyed this, loved the unusual story and learning about the 20s. One of the few school assigned books I have enjoyed. <br> <br>
            
            <b>- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553593714/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513031316&sr=1-1&keywords=a+game+of+thrones+book+1">A Game of Thrones </a></b> by George R. R. Martin. Q1 2017 <br> 
            Big fan of the TV shows, so eventually going to get the whole series down. This took a very long time for me to read, especially since I knew what was going to happen at most points. Yet, still amazing writting and detail that is left out of the TV series. Hopefully I'll be caught up by the time Martin releases the next book (that differs from the TV series). <br> <br>
